Quick help:

To install:  Just drag "Dink Smallwood.app" out of the .dmg to the desktop or a folder and double click it to play.

This app is code signed with the Robinson Technologies certificate for security.  OS X will NOT ask you to change your default
security settings to run this app, if it does, this may be tampered with, so don't run it.  For safety, only download directly from
rtsoft.com.  (or dinknetwork.com, that's probably ok)

KNOWN ISSUE: The game can randomly crash on startup with an OpenGL error on some systems - run it again and it will probably work!
