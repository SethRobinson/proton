	///
	/// This function behaves differently depending on OS and path_type.
	/// In Windows, if the relative_path begins with a drive letter, and
	/// the driver letter differs from the base path, the path is
	/// converted to an absolute path using the current directory for that
	/// drive. Likewise, if the specified base path does not include a
	/// drive or its path is not absolute, the current drive and directory
	/// is added. The function converts all slashes to backslashes.
	///
	/// If the OS is unix based, there is no location (drive or share name)
	/// and the function also converts all backslashes to slashes.
	///
	/// If the type is path_type_virtual, the base path is required to be
	/// absolute. If it does not start in a slash, the function prefixes a
	/// slash to the path. The current drive or directory is never taken into
	/// account and all backslashes are converted to slashes.
	///
	/// This function calls normalise() on base_path and relative_path.
	///
	/// Example #1:
	/// \code
	/// CL_String str = CL_PathHelp::make_absolute("ABD/DEF/", "GFX/Filename.txt", CL_PathHelp::path_type_file);
